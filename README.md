# Societal Biases in Slovak AI

This is the repository for our project [_Societal Biases in Slovak AI_](https://kinit.sk/project/societal-biases-in-slovak-ai-gender-biases/).

* We have moved the code and data related to *machine translation* and *language modeling* to the [GEST](https://github.com/kinit-sk/gest) repository. The code was extended to support additional languages (English, Belarusian, Russian, Ukrainian, Croatian, Serbian, Slovene, Czech, Polish, Slovak).
* The code for *speech-to-text* model lives in [this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1myfRXzx7-JUnvg_UWCajtw_aV3M27rB4?usp=sharing).

_This project was funded by the U.S. Embassy in Slovakia._
