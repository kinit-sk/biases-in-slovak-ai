# Societal Biases in Slovak AI

This repository contains experiments for the project [_Societal Biases in Slovak AI_](https://kinit.sk/project/societal-biases-in-slovak-ai-gender-biases/).

We have moved the code and data related to *machine translation* and *language modeling* to the [GEST](https://github.com/kinit-sk/gest) repository. The code was extended to support additional languages (English, Belarusian, Russian, Ukrainian, Croatian, Serbian, Slovene, Czech, Polish, Slovak).

The code for *speech-to-text* experiments is located in the [`speech_to_text`](speech_to_text) directory in this repository.

_This project was funded by the U.S. Embassy in Slovakia._
